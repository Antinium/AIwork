March 6, 2001	        Version 1.2

        - Created Flocking design-time and run-time package
        - Created FlockReg File to register components
        - Added TFlock and TFlockWorld Icons
        - Changed TFlock to TCustomFlock and then added TFlock descendant
          to expose properties
        - Moved Flock (TCollection) creation into AfterConstruction method
        - Added TCustomFlock.CreateFlock protected method
        - Defined TBoidClass
        - Added overloaded constructor for TFlockCollection to accept
          TBoidClass
        - Made TCustomFlock.Boids property writable
        - TBoid property changes now correctly signal a change event
        - Added BeginUpdate and EndUpdate methods to TCustomFlock
        - Added OnBoidAdded, OnBoidDelete, OnBoidExecuted, OnBoidExecuting
          OnApplyAvoidance, OnApplyAlignment, OnApplyCohesion,
          OnApplySeparation, OnClear, OnExecuting, OnExecuted events
          to TCustomFlock
        - Added Overloaded CrossProduct, DotProduct, and DistanceTo
          methods to TVector, which accept 3 reals
        - Added ProtoFlock TFlock instance in FlockMain, holds default flock
          parameters for when flocks are created.  Also allows
          design-time specification of flock properties
        - Added Shapes to avoid in FlockMain!!!  Shapes must be the first series
          in the TChart.  This application resets the change to move
          directly away from the shape... to be more realistic,
          the boid should probably move along the wall of the
          shape
        - Changed TFlockWorld instance to design-time in FlockMain
        - Set Chart dimensions based on TFlockWorld dimensions at
          form creation

January 27, 2001	Version 1.1

	- Added AutoCalcProperties to TFlock (On by default)
	- Added "Follow Mouse" Checkbox and MouseOver code to test the AutoCalcProperties
	  Note that the Separation, Alignment, and Avoidance flocking rules' strengths need to
          be turned down to really see this
	- Recompiled Help Files with my HelpScribble key INSTALLED this time :)
