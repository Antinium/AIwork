      <H1>The History of AI</H1>Mankind has long been curious about how the mind 
      works and fascinated by intelligent machines. From Talos, the copper giant 
      in <I>Iliad </I>, Pinocchio, the fairy wooden puppet acting like a real 
      boy, and the early debates on the nature of the mind and thought by 
      European philosophers and mathematicians, we can see people's desire to 
      understand and even to create intelligence. 
      <P>
      <H2>The Birth of AI (1945-56)</H2>However, it wasn't until the postwar 
      period (1945-1956) that Artificial Intelligence would emerge as a 
      widely-discussed field. What propelled the birth of Artificial 
      Intelligence were the arrival of modern computer technology and the arise 
      of a critical mass. Pioneers such as <A 
      href="http://www.generation5.org/minsky.shtml">Marvin Minsky</A>, John 
      McCarthy, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon led their students in defining 
      the new and promising field. The development of the modern computer 
      technology effected the AI research tremendously. Many pioneers of AI 
      broke away from the traditional approach of artificial neurons and decided 
      that the human thought could be more efficiently emulated with modern 
      digital computer. Those who did not accept digital computers as the new 
      approach stayed in the parallel field of <A 
      href="http://www.generation5.org/nnintro.shtml">neural network</A>. 
      <P>
      <H2>The Dawning Age of AI (1956-63)</H2>The Dartmouth Conference of 1956 
      brought AI to a new era. 1956-1963 represents the dawning of a an 
      intensive AI wave. During this period, major AI research centers such as 
      <A href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</A> and its Lincoln Laboratory, <A 
      href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</A>, and <A 
      href="http://www.ibm.edu/">IBM </A>concentrated their work on two main 
      themes. First, the attempt to limit the breadth of searches in 
      trial-and-error problems led to the initiation of projects such as Logic 
      Theorist (considered as the first AI program), Geometry Theorem Prover, 
      and SAINT. Next, the study on computer learning includes projects on 
      chess, checkers, and pattern recognition programs. Specialized 
      list-processing AI languages such as LISP were also developed in MIT and 
      other places in 1958. 
      <P>
      <H2>The Maturation of AI (1963-70)</H2>By mid 60's, AI had become the 
      common goal of thousands of different studies. AI researchers utilized 
      their programming techniques and the improved computers in pursuing 
      various projects. However, the memories of computers during these years 
      were still very limited. Perception and knowledge representation in 
      computers became the theme of many AI researches. One representative 
      project was the Blocks Micro World project carried out in MIT. Facing a 
      collection of pure geometric shapes, the robots looked through cameras and 
      interpreted what they had seen. Then, they would move about, manipulate 
      blocks and express their perceptions, activities, and motivations. With 
      the booming of AI, the rival science of <A 
      href="http://www.generation5.org/nnintro.shtml">artificial neural 
      network</A> would face the downfall especially after the exposure of basic 
      flaws in its research in "Perceptron" by Minsky and Papert. 
      <P>
      <H2>The Specialization of Various AI Studies (1970's)</H2>Different 
      AI-related studies had developed into recognizable specialties during the 
      70's. Edward Feigenbaum pioneered the research on expert systems; Roger 
      Schank promoted language analysis with a new way of interpreting the 
      meaning of words; Marvin Minksy propelled the field of knowledge 
      representation a step further with his new structures for representing 
      mental constructs; Douglas Lenat explored automatic learning and the 
      nature of heuristics; David Marr improved computer vision; the authors of 
      PROLOG language presented a convenient higher language for AI researhes. 
      The specialization of AI in the 70's greatly strengthened the backbone of 
      AI theories. However, AI applications were still few and premature. 
      <P>
      <H2>The Unfulfilled Expectations (1980's)</H2>The 1980's was a period of 
      rollercoasting for AI. The anti-science tradition of the public was 
      improved greatly following the appearance of <I>Star Wars</I> movies and 
      the new popularity of the personal computers. XCON, the first expert 
      system employed in industrial world, symbolized the budding of real AI 
      application. Within four years, XCON had grown tenfold with an investment 
      of fifty person-years in the program and an achievement of saving about 
      forty million dollards in testing and manufacturing costs for the 
      industrial clients. Following the brilliant success was the AI boom. The 
      number of AI groups increased tremendously and in 1985, 150 companies 
      spent about $1 billion altogether on internal AI groups. However, the 
      fundamental AI algorithm was still unsatisfying. As <A 
      href="http://www.generation5.org/minsky.shtml">Marvin Minsky</A> warned 
      the over-confident public: these seemingly intelligent programs simply 
      make dumb decisions faster. Indeed, the warning foreshadowed the downfall 
      of AI industry in late 80's. The replacing of LISP machines by standard 
      microcomputers with AI softwares in the popular C language in 1987 and the 
      unstability of expert systems caused a painful transition on expert system 
      industry; the computer vision industry also suffered from a big setback 
      when Machine Vision International crashed in 1988; one other major loss 
      was the failure in Autonomous Land Vehicle project (AI drivers + 
      Robotics). The AI industry started recovering at the end of the 80's but 
      learning from the past experience, public assumed a much more conservative 
      view on AI ever since. Another notable event is the revisitting of neural 
      network with the work done by the Parallel Distributed Processing Study 
      Group. In 1989, about three hundred companies were founded to compete for 
      the predicted $1 billion market for neural nets by the end of the century. 

      <P>
      <H2>AI Being Incorporated in War (early 1990's)</H2>The Persian Gulf War 
      in the early 90's proved the importance of AI research for <A 
      href="http://www.generation5.org/app_military.shtml">military use</A>. 
      Tasks as simple as packing a transport plane and as complicated as the 
      timing and coordination of Operation Desert Storm were assisted by 
      AI-oriented expert systems. Advanced weapons such as "cruise missiles" 
      were equipped with technologies previously studies in different AI-related 
      fields such as Robotics and Machine Vision. Two projects successing the 
      Automated Land Vehicle project were the Pilot's Associate project 
      (electronic copilot) and the Battle Management System project (military 
      expert systems). 
      <P>
      <H2>New AI Applications (late 1990's)</H2>The victory of Deep Blue over 
      chess champion Kasparov in 1996 led to a new summit of AI gaming. A new 
      branch of expert systems has been expected to prosper as Genetic 
      Engineering matures. Manipulating such gigantic knowledge base of human 
      DNA map (Bioinformatics) will require very specialized algorithms and AI 
      researches. 
      <P>
      <H2>An Overview</H2>AI is a result of the merge of philosophy, 
      mathematics, psychology, neurology, linguistics, computer science, and 
      many other fields. Futhermore, the application of AI relates to almost any 
      fields. This variety gives AI an endless potential. A relatively young 
      science, AI has made much progress in 50 years. Though fast-growing, AI 
      has never actually caught up with all the expectation imposed on it. There 
      are two reasons for public's over-confidence in AI. First, AI theories are 
      often ingenious and subtle even fictional, implying much futuristic 
      applications. Second, AI, being incorporated with computer technology, is 
      often expected to progress as fast as the computer technology. 
      Conclusionally, AI is a young, energetic, and attractive science.
